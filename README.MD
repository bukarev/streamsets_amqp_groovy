### Motivation

[Apache Qpid](https://qpid.apache.org/index.html) is an AMQP broker. Tests have been made, and Streamsets Data Collectorâ€™s (SDC) standard stages RabbitMQ and VMS are not capable of integrating with Apache Qpid. Another approach, which is discussed below, is by using Groovy evaluator. 

Java-based [VMS client](https://qpid.apache.org/components/jms/index.html) library can be integrated into SDC to read messages from Qpid queues or send messages to Qpid.
